## Tokenomics

## 3 Pagers / Whitepaper

- What problem do we solve?
- Why using blockchain is important, and how does it benefit the users (compared to a Web 2 app, for example)?
- What are the advantages compared to existing projects?
- How much money should be raised? (Gantt chart and financial plan allocation)


**Recommendation:**
*The ideal white paper should be a balanced combination of selling the ICO without being a marketing document. It should be more like a technical paper, but avoid jargon that clearly identifies a problem before proposing a credible step-by-step solution to that problem.*
